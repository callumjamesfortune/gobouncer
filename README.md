# GOBOUNCER

I wanted to be able to log IPs, and I wanted to learn a bit of Go, so naturally I did both!

If you want me to see your IP address for whatever reason please just hit `ubuntu.seefortune.co.uk/gobouncer`

Optionally, you can add a redirect query param like `?redirect=https://bbc.co.uk`

Cheers ;)
